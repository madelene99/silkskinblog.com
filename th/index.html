                            ชอบจังเลยค่ะที่เล่นใช้ Flex Fit สามารถควบคุมการใช้แรงได้ด้วยค่ะ ทดแทนเครื่องโปรดที่ใช้ประจำได้เลย คือจริงๆแล้วมันก็เทียบเท่ากับดำมเบลล์ที่มีน้ำหนักตั้งแต่ 4,5 ถึง 23 กก. ท่าที่ชอบที่สุดคือท่าบริหารกล้ามเนื้อสามหัวกับบั้นท้าย ผ่านไปแค่ 2 อาทิตย์แต่กล้ามแข็งแรงขึ้นมากจนสังเกตได้ค่ะ
